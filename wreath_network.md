## Wreath Network

In this opportunity, I bring you the write-up for the Wreath tryhackme room https://tryhackme.com/room/wreath. This one is different from others since it is a network of machines that we have to compromise, pivoting between them and getting further into the network with each jump.

The author of the room requested that the write-up should have a professional format. [Find the write-up here](https://npalumbo.github.io/thm-writeups/report_wreath.pdf).

Thank you for reading this. If you wish to contact me and suggest any amendments or changes, you can reach me out on [linkedin](https://es.linkedin.com/in/nicol%C3%A1s-palumbo-9372615) or [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/p/nicopalumbo).
